# Sayari Data Task

Repository created for the completion of the Sayari Data Task.

The repository has been structed in the form of a Scrapy project with Sayari_data_task/ND_businesses as the directory. 
To generate the scraped data with a scrapy project, run `scrapy crawl ND_businesses -O ND_businesses.json` running just the spider itself will not produce and output.
network_graph.py can then be run to generate a png of the network graph.
